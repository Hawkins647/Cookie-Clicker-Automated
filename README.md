# Cookie-Clicker-Automated
A program that automates the process of playing cookie clicker.

Created to work with https://cookieupdate.neocities.org/, but you can alter the images in the program to work with any version you want. 

NOTE: pyautogui is inconsistent with detecting images on a screen, so sometimes the mouse may not move when it is supposed to.
